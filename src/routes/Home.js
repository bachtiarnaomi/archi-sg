      <h3>Connecting architects to the resources they need.</h3>
      <p>
        There are many challenges that architects face, from authority
        submissions, navigating PPE process to gaining salary insights. It
        doesn't have to be this challenging. <br />
        <br />
        The first step to making life easier is through resource sharing. There
        have been several ground-up initiatives and Archi.sg is a compilation of
        these initiatives. In particular, the SIA-YAL community has compiled a
        library, which became a key reference for this website.
